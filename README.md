# Topic List
1. Representation of information with binary bits (e.g., Unsigned binary, 2's complement)
2. Combinational design (e.g., truth tables, logic gates, modular design, hierarchical design)
3. Sequential logic design (e.g., flip-flops, finite state machines)
4. Computer organization (e.g., register files, ALUs)
5. Assembly language programming
6. Input/output strategies for computer architectures
7. Pipelining (e.g., pipeline stages plus resolving structural, data, and control hazards)
8. Caches (e.g., block size, associativity, and optimizing code for caches)
9. Virtual memory and disks
10. Survey of approaches to parallelization (e.g., SIMD, multi-core, cache coherence)
